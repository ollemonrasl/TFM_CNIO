Scripts and documents for the systematic identification of context-depending high-order interactions using large-scale cancer genomics. 

Scripts containing general logarithmic-linear regression model for:
  - Two-way approach (interaction between mutation-CNAs)
  - Three-way approach (interaction among mutation-CNAs-stage)
  - Three way approach (interaction between mutation-CNAs and mutations in new genes) (TWOGENES)

Result files used in the TFM for each model.
